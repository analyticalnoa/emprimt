NAME
    emprimt - a simple email-to-print service.

SYNOPSIS
    emprimt -h
    emprimt

CONFIGURATION
    First see DEPENDENCIES. We assume you have already setup desired printers with CUPS.

    `$HOME' refers to the emprimt user's home directory, not just anyone's; see below.

    You'll need to configure fetchmail with your email address(s) to pipe messages to
    maildrop, which will depend on your provider. We've included a `./sample_fetchmailrc',
    which you should copy to `$HOME/.fetchmailrc' and modify as needed. Just ensure that
    you send messages to maildrop by keeping the line

        mda "maildrop"

    IMPORTANT: Also filter messages by size so that you don't fill the disk. We've
    included the line

        limit 20000000

    to only deliver mail of size 20 MiB and under.

    As superuser, run

        ./install

    to setup emprimt without automating it with cron. You'll be prompted to create a
    password for the new dedicated emprimt system user. If you want to install a
    crontab for emprimt to run every five minutes, run

        ./install --enable

    Edit the crontab if you'd like to change this frequency.

    The install script will create an empty file in `$HOME/.emprimt' called `printers'. In
    this file, list the names of the printers that emprimt can print to, one per line.
    For a list of qualified printer names, run

        lpstat -p -d

    Beyond that, feel free to tweak the `$HOME/.mailfilter' file to further control which
    emails get through to emprimt; see the maildroprc manpage for details.

DESCRIPTION
    To use emprimt, simply run `emprimt' from the command line, as the emprimt user.

    emprimt prints any PDF documents attached to mail with a subject line that contains
    a qualified printer name(s) appearing in the `$HOME/.emprimt/printers' file. The
    attachment(s) will be printed to the subject-line-specified printer appearing first
    on the printers list. Documents will be printed with the default printing options set
    by CUPS.
